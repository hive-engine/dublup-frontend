    <p>Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user and Forecast Research Group with respect to the Dublup Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and Forecast Research Group with respect to the Dublup Site, except for any Customer Agreement into which you enter with Forecast Research Group. In the case of any conflict, the terms of that Customer Agreement will control. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to the parties that this agreement and all related documents be written in English.</p>

    <h4>Dispute Resolution</h4><hr>

    <p>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Forecast Research Group and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</p>

    <h4>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</h4><hr>

    <p>You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Dublup Site, to any products sold or distributed through the Dublup Site, or to any aspect of your relationship with Forecast Research Group, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or Forecast Research Group may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</p>

    <h4>Arbitration Rules and Forum</h4><hr>

    <p>The Venezuelan Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to the Arbitration Centre of the Caracas Chamber (CACC). If CACC is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.</p>

    <p>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

    <h4>Authority of Arbitrator</h4><hr>

    <p>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Forecast Research Group. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p>

    <h4>Waiver of Jury Trial</h4><hr>

    <p>YOU AND COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Forecast Research Group are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Applicability or Arbitration Agreement section above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>

    <h4>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief</h4><hr>

    <p>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, than then claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in Venezuela.</p>

    <p>All other claims shall be arbitrated.</p>

    <h4>Severability</h4><hr>

    <p>Except as provided in the Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief subsection, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

    <h4>Survival of Agreement</h4><hr>

    <p>This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Forecast Research Group.</p>

    <h4>Assignment</h4><hr>

    <p>The Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated or otherwise transferred by you without Forecast Research Group’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.</p>

    <h4>Changes to Terms</h4><hr>

    <p>Forecast Research Group reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change the Terms under which Dublup Site is offered. The most current version of the Terms will supersede all previous versions. Forecast Research Group encourages you to periodically review the Terms to stay informed of our updates.</p>
